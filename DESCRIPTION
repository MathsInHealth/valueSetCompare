Description: The number of countries with multiple Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) value sets is growing, and this trend is expected to continue. 
    Each instrument and value set characterizes and values health differently. Identical health states can yield different utility values when valued 
    using different value sets. The 'valueSetCompare' package facilitates comparisons of HRQoL value sets, enabling both theoretical and empirical comparisons.
    For empirical comparisons, it employs a novel simulation-based method by Jiang et al. (2022) <doi:10.1186/s12955-022-02031-8>, allowing users to investigate
    the responsiveness of HRQoL instruments across the entire health spectrum using cross-sectional data with external health anchors.
